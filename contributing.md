# Contributing

Please first discuss the change you wish to make via email (benjamin.gallois@fasttrack.sh) before contributing to the Fast Track project. Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it.

## Installation

Before contributing to Fast Track, make sure to have a working environment of development, [see the developer guide](http://http://www.fasttrack.sh/API/index.html).

## Contributing

### Create an account

To contribute to Fast Track, first, you have to create an [account](https://git.benjamin-gallois.fr).

### Create a branch

Before any work can be done, you have to create a new branch. If you are working on a new feature, branch the dev branch. For a bug fix, branch the master branch.

#### Branch naming convention

The branch must always follow this naming convention:
```name/type/description```
With:
* name: gitlab name
* type: keywords among the commit type list (see below)
* description: short description in lower case, maximum 4 words separated by a hyphen

```
$ git checkout master
$ git pull master
$ git push origin master
$ git checkout -b bgallois/docs/update-contributing
```

```
$ git checkout dev
$ git pull dev
$ git push origin dev
$ git checkout -b bgallois/fix/fix-crash-crop
```


### Create a commit

#### Commit naming convention

Each commit must follow this naming convention to ensure the readability of the commit history:
```
[type] scope: description
```

##### Commit type

* `build`: Changes in build and deployment scripts.
* `docs`: Changes in the documentation.
* `feat`: Implementation of new functionality.
* `fix`: Fix a bug.
* `opti`: Performance optimization.
* `ref`: Code refactoring.
* `style`: User interface refactoring.
* `rel`: Release, note that they are no scope in these commits.
* `test`: Changes in the tests.
* `wip`: Saved work in progress, temporary commit not authorized in the final merge.

##### Commit scope

* `global`: All the project.
* `interactive`: Changes in the interactive tracking class.
* `replay`: Changes in the replay class.
* `batch`: Changes in the batch class.
* `main`: Changes in the mainwindow class.
* `tracking`: Changes in the tracking class.

The scope is determined by the modification made in the commit, the scope is always the part of the code that has required to create a new commit. For example, a new feature in the interactive class that requires a modification in the tracking class has an interactive scope. A bug that appears in the interactive class but that is caused by an error in the tracking class has a tracking scope.

### Formatting

Fast Track is using [Clang format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) to ensure the homogeneity of code formatting inside the project.
* Format your code according to the .clang-format file.
* Format your documentation following the [Doxygen](http://doxygen.nl/) formatting.
* Follow a standard C++ [naming convention](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Naming).  
### Test

Fast Track is using [Google Test framework](https://github.com/google/googletest) to perform unitary tests.
* Each commit has to pass all the tests, to run the test:
```
$ ./test.sh
```
* If you add some features to the tracking algorithm, you have to implement tests. New features to the tracking algorithm without tests will be refused.
* New features that are purely on the graphical interface can omit tests.
* 
### Create a merge request

Before creating the merge request, make sure that you follow the project guidelines. Pull request that will not follow all the guidelines will be automatically refused.
```
git push -u origin bgallois/docs/update-contributing
```

```
$ git push -u origin -b bgallois/fix/fix-crash-crop
```

Go to the [project page](https://git.benjamin-gallois.fr/bgallois/FastTrack) and click on the **Merge Request** tab. Click on **New merge request**. Select the source branch and the target branch and click on **Compare branches and continue** button. Finally, click on the **Submit merge request**.
