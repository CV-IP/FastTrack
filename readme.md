## About

Tracking objects in video recording can be tedious. Existing software are expensive, the learning curve can be steep, and the workflow can not be easily adapted when the project evolved.

**FastTrack** is a desktop tracking software, easy to install, easy to use, and performant. The software can be downloaded and modified to adapt to any needs. The core of the software can also be embedded easily in any C++/Qt project.

Two main features are implemented in the software:
* An automatic tracking algorithm that can detect and track objects (conserving the objects' identities across the video recording).
* A manual review of the tracking where errors can be corrected rapidly and easily to achieve 100% accuracy.
