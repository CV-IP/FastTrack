# Fast Track

Fast Track is a cross-platform application designed to track multiple objects in video recording. Stable versions of the software are available for Linux, Mac and Windows.

Two main features are implemented in the software:
* An automatic tracking algorithm that can detect and track objects (conserving the objects identities across the video recording).
* A manual review of the tracking where errors can be corrected rapidly and easily by hand.
