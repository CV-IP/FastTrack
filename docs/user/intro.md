Welcome to the FastTrack user manual. This manual will present the tracking software and how to use it. Please contact by email at **benjamin.gallois@fasttrack.sh** or chat on [irc](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#fasttrackorg) if you need more information or to signal a bug.

FastTrack is a cross-platform application designed to track multiple objects in video recording. Stable versions of the software are available for Linux, Mac, and Windows. The source code can be downloaded at https://github.com/FastTrackOrg/FastTrack.

Two main features are implemented in the software:
-  An automatic tracking algorithm that can detect and track objects, conserving the objects' identities across the video recording.
-  An ergonomic tool allowing the user to check, correct and annotate the tracking.

FastTrack was first a PhD thesis side project started by [Benjamin Gallois](https://github.com/bgallois) on his spare time that has then taken dedicated time in his PhD project. The core of the software is still maintained on his spare time and new features implementation, bug fixes and help can take some time.

**Not sure if you want to use FastTrack? Check these five most common questions:**

**What video quality is required?**
FastTrack is designed to work with any video quality and frame rate.

**What type of objects and numbers can FastTrack handled?**
See [this movie](https://youtu.be/zFz5YPjx7jA) to have a broad overview of what FastTrack is capable of.

**How it performs?**
Tracking performances depend on systems (number and type of objects). But with the build-in ergonomic tool, it is possible to achieve 100% tracking accuracy with a minimum of efforts.
