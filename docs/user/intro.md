Welcome to the FastTrack user manual. This manual will be presenting the tracking software FastTrack and how to use it. Please contact **benjamin.gallois@fasttrack.sh** if you need more information or to signal a bug.

FastTrack is a cross-platform application designed to track multiple objects in video recording. Stable versions of the software are available for Linux, Mac, and Windows. The source code can be downloaded at https://git.gallois.cc/bgallois/FastTrack.

Two main features are implemented in the software:
-   An automatic tracking algorithm that can detect and track objects, conserving the objects' identities across the video recording).
