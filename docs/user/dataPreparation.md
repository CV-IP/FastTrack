FastTrack can only analyze image sequences. The images must follow the
zeroes padding naming convention (name00000.extension, name00001.extension, name00002.extension …).
“pgm”, “png”, “jpeg”, “jpg”, “tiff”, “tif”, “bmp”, “dib”, “jpe”, “jp2”, “webp”, “pbm”, “ppm”, “sr”, “ras”, “tif” image formats are supported.

FastTrack can directly convert video files in image sequences. Selecting the **Interactive Tracking** panel, click on **File** then on **Open a video**. You can then now select video files (most common formats are supported). A new folder with the image sequence is then created alongside the original video file.
