FastTrack can **only** analyze image sequences. The images must follow the
zeroes padding naming convention (name00000.extension, name00001.extension, name00002.extension …).
“pgm”, “png”, “jpeg”, “jpg”, “tiff”, “tif”, “bmp”, “dib”, “jpe”, “jp2”, “webp”, “pbm”, “ppm”, “sr”, “ras”, “tif” image formats are supported.

A built-in tool to convert video files in image sequences is available: 
- Select the **Interactive Tracking** panel
- Click on **File**
- Click on **Open a video**
- Click on **Open video files**
- Select one or several movies (most common formats are supported)
- A folder with the image sequence is created for each movie in the same directory as the video file.
