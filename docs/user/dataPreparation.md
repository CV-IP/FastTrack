FastTrack can only analyze image sequences. The images must follow the
zeroes padding naming convention (name00000.extension,
name00001.extension, name00002.extension …).
“pgm”, “png”, “jpeg”,
“jpg”, “tiff”, “tif”, “bmp”, “dib”, “jpe”, “jp2”, “webp”, “pbm”, “ppm”,
“sr”, “ras”, “tif” image formats are supported.

If you have a recording in a video format, you need to convert it into
an image sequence. You can do it directly inside FastTrack by selecting the **Interactive Tracking** panel, clicking on File then on **Open a video**. You can then select your video files (most common formats are supported). A new folder with the image sequence is then created alongside the original video file.
