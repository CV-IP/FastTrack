**NOTE**

During the installation on Windows and Mac systems, some security alerts can be displayed due to the fact that the Fast Track executable does not possess an EV code signing certificate.
These certificates have to be buy (~500$ a year) that is not tolerable. Fast Track executable can be verified easily (and freely) by doing an MD5 checksum and ignoring these alerts.
